                                <strong>Systems Operation, Support, and Security</strong> is the final phase in the systems development
                                life cycle. You will support and maintain the system, handle security issues, protect
                                the integrity of the system and its data, and be alert to any signs of obsolescence. The
                                deliverable for this phase is an operational system that is properly maintained,
                                supported, and secured. The systems support and security phase begins when a system
                                becomes operational and continues until the system reaches the end of its useful lifeâ€¢
                                After delivering the system, the IT team focuses on support and maintenance tasks

                            <p>
                                The growing number of instances of breaches in information security in the last few
                                years has created a compelling case for efforts towards secure electronic systems.
                                Embedded systems, which will be ubiquitously used to capture, store, manipulate, and
                                access data of a sensitive nature, pose several unique and interesting security
                                challenges. Security has been the subject of intensive research in the areas of
                                cryptography, computing, and networking. However, despite these efforts, security is
                                often mis-construed by designers as the hardware or software implementation of specific
                                cryptographic algorithms and security protocols.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In reality, it is an entirely new metric that designers should consider throughout the
                                design process, along with other metrics such as cost, performance, and power..This
                                paper is intended to introduce embedded system designers and design tool developers to
                                the challenges involved in designing secure embedded systems. We attempt to provide a
                                unified and holistic view of embedded system security by first analyzing the typical
                                functional security requirements for embedded systems from an end-user perspective.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We then identify the implied challenges for embedded system architects, as well as
                                hardware and software designers (e.g., tamper-resistant embedded system design,
                                processing requirements for security, impact of security on battery life for
                                battery-powered systems, etc.). We also survey solution techniques to address these
                                challenges, drawing from both current practice and emerging research, and identify open
                                research problems that will require innovations in embedded system architecture and
                                design methodologies.
