# Learn-SDLC
An online platform to learn Systems Development Life Cycle in a fun and interesting way. 

This started out as a project from my System Analysis class, geared towards practicing SCRUM software developement methodology and learn more about the System Development Life Cycle. My team's name was 'TeamNoClue', cause we were bad at naming :p We had five developers in team, and all the roles were divided among us. For info on team members and their roles please go here: 
My role was that of Lead Developer and Designer. My task was to plan, design and develop the whole platform, inside which, individual components developed by other team members will be integrated to come up with a complete learning platform at end. As heavy as it sounds.

Following is my work on the Learn-SDLC platform:

# Planning

### Purpose (user stories for me)
Learn-SDLC is an online platform where anyone can learn about what SDLC is, and how it is used in the technology industry.
   1. It should be website that anyone can use regardless of age or background. 
   2. It should be fun and engaging for the children while still being resourceful and assistive to elderly people.
   3. Should be accessible from both anywhere through different web browser (responsive and multi-browser compatibility).
   4. Provide the knowledge in a systematic and proper way, besides giving a way of measuring the information grasped.
   5. Allow users to learn a little bit beyond SDLC by introducing further learning opportunities.
   6. Acknowledge to learners some relevant and useful learning resources available over the internet.

### How it works 
   1. Main home page of website describes the way the platform works and provide user with links to various important sections of the website like Study Area, Games, and About page.
   2. The learning process starts from the Study Area. Following is the working of study area, or the real teaching concept of the Learn-SDLC website. Various parts of the Study Area and there purpose:
     1. Introduction: Gives a brief introduction of the topic along with Definition breakdown to make the concept more clear.
     2. Explanation: This section explains the whole concept with proper and detailed explanation. It make it less boring, more emphasis is placed on using visuals and graphics where ever possible.
     3. Examples makes it easier to understand the real world application of the concept learned. This section contains various examples based on real world usage of SDLC
     4. Testing the knowledge is the best way to retain it for long term, and it also servers as a measure to check knowledge actually gained. This section uses the Quizzlet.com app, on which user can take quizs, test or play games like Scatters, Flashcards and Space game.
   
    User studies each concept of SDLC starting from SDLC itself then progressing in a systematic order - Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation and then System Support and Security. For each of these concepts, the above layed out format is followed. Starting with introduction, then explaning the topics in detail and then giving some relevant examples before testing how much user was able to learn.
   3. At last, provide user with quick link to some of the most relevant and useful resources on the internet to study more about SDLC. Users are also provided with a separate page for fun games to test their knowledge and it also helps to improve the learning skills.

# Designing

### Design Layout
Various components of the website were designed and planned at first taking into consideration the purpose and page-structure of the website. Header, Navigation panels, body section (main view) and the footer section, were all designed using web design tools.

### CSS - Bootstrap, Materialize CSS and Angular Material Design
Due to the limitation of developing the whole platform in just 2 weeks, it was decided to use the available CSS frameworks. The responsibility of choosing the framework and designing the website was put on my shoulders. Depending on the website requirements, mainly that it should be a fun and engaging while still being easily accessible through various devices, I decided to use a combination of CSS frameworks for best productivity and fluidity. I decided to use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS and my custom CSS styles. Bootstrap was basically used for creating responsive web structure, and materialize fulfilled the need of creating a more colorful and fun looking website. Angular Material Design was also heavily used

### Properties
Dimensions supported - At least 720 px wide screen, and best viewed at 1330 px wide screen.
