Implementation is the process that actually yields the lowest-level system elements in the system hierarchy (system breakdown structure). System elements are made, bought, or reused. Production involves the hardware fabrication processes of forming, removing, joining, and finishing, the software realization processes of coding and testing, or the operational procedures development processes for operators' roles. If implementation involves a production process, a manufacturing system which uses the established technical and management processes may be required.

The purpose of the implementation process is to design and create (or fabricate) a system element conforming to that element’s design properties and/or requirements. The element is constructed employing appropriate technologies and industry practices. This process bridges the system definition processes and the integration process. Figure 1 portrays how the outputs of system definition relate to system implementation, which produces the implemented (system) elements required to produce aggregates and the SoI.

During the implementation process, engineers apply the design properties and/or requirements allocated to a system element to design and produce a detailed description. They then fabricate, code, or build each individual element using specified materials, processes, physical or logical arrangements, standards, technologies, and/or information flows outlined in detailed descriptions (drawings or other design documentation). A system element will be verified against the detailed description of properties and validated against its requirements.
