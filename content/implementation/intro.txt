The systems implementation process in terms of construction and delivery phases of the life cycle. Systems implementation is the construction of the new system and the delivery of that system into production (that is, the day-to-day business or organization operation). System Implementation uses the structure created during architectural design and the results of system analysis to construct system elements that meet the stakeholder requirements and system requirements developed in the early life cycle phases. These system elements are then integrated to form intermediate aggregates and finally the complete system-of-interest (SoI).
