Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering. It is meant to satisfy specific needs and requirements of a business or organization through the engineering of a coherent and well-running system.
