System planning is done by people who have faith in the future and a vision of the future adequate to form the basis for planning. System planning has two major outputs which embody its contributions. These are proposals and design concepts. The proposal is addressed to the decision-maker. One of its main ingredients consists of a statement of the objectives of the system. The objectives may be set by the system planner, or they may be articulated by him as an expression of his understanding of the concensus of other responsible persons. Design concepts evolving from system planning are based on the visualized system, and are addressed primarily to the system engineer.
