The Planning Phase focuses principally on required project planning work. Proper
comprehensive project planning is essential to a successful IT project, and incomplete project
planning and analysis are frequently root causes of project failure. Most project planning is
conducted as part of the PMBOK Integration Management work, which includes defining the
processes necessary to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate all project activities for
successful project deployment.

Objectives
Successful completion of the Planning Phase should comprise:
• Assessment and description of the procurement management strategy

• Definition of procedures for how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and
closed
• Planning the future course of action
• Development of the Project Management Plan(s) (PMP)

Goals
The purpose of the Planning Phase is to plan all project processes and activities required to
